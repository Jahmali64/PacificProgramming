I wrote this API with the intent to display a variety of skill sets. I could have also used a minimal API/microservices approach, which would have been much simpler, but I wanted more room to demonstrate some of my skills. I used various design patterns while keeping principles like SOLID and DRY in mind with a clear focus on scalability. The current setup could be described as "over-engineering", but again my aim here was to not only complete the tasks but also to demonstrate my proficiency in a variety of areas.

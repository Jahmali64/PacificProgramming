# PacificProgramming Tasks

1. How did you verify that everything works correctly?
    - Wrote and ran unit tests, integration tests, and end to end tests.
    - Tested the api using swagger and postman.
    - Made use of Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension to run the provided frontend and test the api "live".
2. How long did it take you to complete the task?
    - Roughly five hours.
3. What else could be done to your solution to make it ready for production?
    - Logging
    - Caching (in the event this API gets called very frequently)
    - Data validation

### Additional Notes
I wrote this API with the intent to display a variety of skill sets, hence the reason for including all the tests even though it wasn't explicitly asked for. I could have also used a minimal API/microservices approach, which would have been much simpler, but I wanted more room to demonstrate some of my skills. I used various design patterns while keeping principles like SOLID and DRY in mind with a clear focus on scalability. The current setup could be described as "over-engineering", but again my aim here was to not only complete the tasks but also to demonstrate my proficiency in a variety of areas.
